# Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

You will play the game entirely in Free Duel mode. You will start with only a few duelists unlocked, and each time you defeat a duelist
for the first time or acquire a new card, you will unlock a check. Gradually you will unlock more and more duelists via the "Progressive
Duelist" items shuffled among the available checks, all the way up to Final 6.

## What is the goal of Donkey Kong Country 3 when randomized?

Beat Nitemare, or if playing with the "All 6 Shuffled" Final 6 sequence settings, beat the last member of Final 6.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Your access to more duelists is shuffled in the form of a "Progressive Duelist" item.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Your Progressive Duelist items as well as some additional starchips.

## What does another world's item look like in Donkey Kong Country 3

Your item acquisitions take the form of having defeated duelists or having acquired cards in your library/chest. As such,
you'll have to check the BizHawk Client to know the actual items that were unlocked from those locations.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Currently, the items are silently added to the player's inventory, which can be seen in the card library or Free Duel screen.
